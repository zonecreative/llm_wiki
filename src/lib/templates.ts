## Cross-referencing Rules

${BASE_CROSSREF}
- Findings link back to their source via the \`source:\` frontmatter field
- Thesis pages reference supporting and refuting findings via \`related:\`
- Methodology pages are cited by the findings that used them

## Contradiction Handling

${BASE_CONTRADICTION}

## Research-Specific Conventions

- Keep the thesis pages updated as evidence accumulates — they are living documents
- Every finding should assess replication status when known
- Methodology pages explain the *why* (rationale) not just the *how*
- Distinguish between direct evidence and inference in finding pages

## Page Types

| Type | Directory | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
${BASE_SCHEMA_TYPES}
| character | wiki/characters/ | People and figures in the book |
| theme | wiki/themes/ | Recurring ideas, motifs, and symbolic threads |
| plot-thread | wiki/plot-threads/ | Storylines or narrative arcs being tracked |
| chapter | wiki/chapters/ | Per-chapter notes and summaries |

## Naming Conventions

${BASE_NAMING}
- Characters: character name in kebab-case (e.g., \`elizabeth-bennet.md\`)
- Themes: thematic noun phrase (e.g., \`social-class-mobility.md\`, \`deception-vs-honesty.md\`)
- Plot threads: arc description (e.g., \`darcys-redemption-arc.md\`)
- Chapters: \`ch-NN-slug.md\` (e.g., \`ch-01-opening-scene.md\`)

## Frontmatter

## Log Format

${BASE_LOG_FORMAT}

## Cross-referencing Rules

${BASE_CROSSREF}
- Chapter notes reference characters appearing in that chapter via \`related:\`
- Theme pages link to the chapters where the theme is most prominent
- Plot thread pages list chapters that advance the arc

## Contradiction Handling

${BASE_CONTRADICTION}

## Reading-Specific Conventions

- Chapter pages are written during or immediately after reading — capture fresh reactions
- Distinguish between plot summary and personal interpretation in chapter notes
- Theme pages should track *development* across the book, not just state that a theme exists
- Flag unresolved plot threads with status: \`open\` until resolved
- Note page numbers for important quotes to enable re-finding later

## Contradiction Handling

${BASE_CONTRADICTION}

## Personal Growth Conventions

- Be honest in journal and reflection entries — this wiki is for you, not an audience
- Update goal progress fields regularly; stale data is worse than no data
- Distinguish between outcome goals (what you want) and process goals (what you will do)
- Reflect on *why* habits succeed or fail, not just whether they did
- Use the synthesis directory for cross-cutting insights that span multiple goals or periods
